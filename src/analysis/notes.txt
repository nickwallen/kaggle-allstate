# Predictor Variables Brainstorming:
#   -Plan cost relative to other "like-kind" plans quoted (if states/risks change, costs are not comparable)
#   -Plan "Traits" could be correlated ... e.g. - if A=2, could be more probable for B=1
#     Could run categorical correlations on selected plan traits. This would allow us to predict plans in a strategic order
#     & use results from Trait[1] to predict Trait[2]
#   -Recent changes in marital status, group_size, etc. (e.g. - If recently had kids, could change decision)
#   -Number of recent quotes (getting many quotes could point towards frugality)
#   -Price Sensitivity ~ homeowner + car_value + ...

# NOTES:
#   D == 1 is relatively rare
#   G == 4 is relatively rare
